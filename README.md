Working with LLM's -- Large Language Models 
What are LLMs ? 
* LLMs are just an aspect of different AI models that enable them to communicate in human text and make them seem like they possess human intelect, but they work with a vast amount of data that enable them know different text, grammer, speeches and also a sophisticated engine that enable them predict the words that come next at every point in time.
An LLM is a model that uses Generative AI techniques, which are based on Deep Learning and Machine Learning, all of which fall under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence.
  
What is a prompt ?
* Instructions and context provided to an AI for certain tasks

Prompt Engineering ? 
* the practice of developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use an AI for a certain task
